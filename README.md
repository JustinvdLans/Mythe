My work
---
My part in this team was lead developer, there are some things that i developed for this game:
* The wave system;
* The float system;
* The Enemy A.I.

What i really liked about this project was that it took me out of my comfort zone by making me program physics, even though i still don't like programming physics, i liked doing something challenging.

There were some problems while using GitHub, but all our scripts are in the script folder.
